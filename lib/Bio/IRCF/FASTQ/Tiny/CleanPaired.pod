=head1 SYNOPSIS

    extract_singletons_from_paired_fastq A_R1.fastq A_R2.fastq

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given two FASTQ files (e.g. F<A_R1.fastq.gz> and F<A_R2.fastq.gz>), outputs the following:

=over

=item F<A_R1.good_paired.fastq.gz> the original F<A_R1.fastq.gz> file except that "orphans" and "empty" or "too short" sequences have been removed.
=item F<A_R2.good_paired.fastq.gz> the original F<A_R2.fastq.gz> file except that "orphans" and "empty" or "too short" sequences have been removed.
=item F<A_R1.orphans.fastq.gz> sequences from F<A_R1.fastq.gz> that lost its pair from F<A_R2.fastq.gz>
=item F<A_R2.orphans.fastq.gz> sequences from F<A_R2.fastq.gz> that lost its pair from F<A_R1.fastq.gz>
